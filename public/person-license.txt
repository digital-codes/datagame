That means your GLB has AnimationGroups where:

    HumanArmature is the skeleton or node name,

    Man_Walk, Man_Idle, Man_Walk, etc., are AnimationGroup names.
    Or Female_Walk ...



BABYLON.SceneLoader.ImportMesh("", "path/to/", "yourModel.glb", scene, function (meshes, particleSystems, skeletons, animationGroups) {
    // List all animation groups
    console.log(animationGroups.map(ag => ag.name));

   // List all animation groups and their frame ranges
    animationGroups.forEach(group => {
        console.log("Animation Group Name:", group.name);
        console.log("From Frame:", group.from);
        console.log("To Frame:", group.to);
    });

    // STOP all animations first (optional, so they don't overlap)
    animationGroups.forEach(ag => ag.stop());


    // Find a specific animation group by name
    const poseName = "HumanArmature|Man_idle"; // The pose/animation you want
    const pose = animationGroups.find(ag => ag.name === poseName);

    if (pose) {
        // Start the pose animation
        pose.start(false, 1.0, pose.from, pose.to, false); 
        // (no loop, normal speed, from start frame to end frame, no loop)
    }
});
